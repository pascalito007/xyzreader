= Project Overview

In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.
Why this Project?

    Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
    Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
    Separate an interface into surfaces.
    Effectively use transitions and motion.
